## Hi!

suggestions, criticisms, or tips!

## Description

I'm a scientist that does some analysis with Python at work. This is a personal project
to learn how to do some _regular_ software development. I'm focusing on web UIs,
databases, and project management.

### Planned features

- A database of books with information on the book, author, series, and genre.
- Managing local audiobook files: adding, deleting, renaming, and organizing.
- Fetching book information with the [Goodreads](https://goodreads.com) API.
- Syncing between the database and my Goodreads collection.
- Linking to my [Audible](https://audible.com) books.
- A web UI to do all the above.

### Using

#### frameworks

- [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/)
- [SQLAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org)
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)
- [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/)

#### development tools
